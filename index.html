<h1>Hello Freelancers</h1>
<h2>Health insurance for freelancers: voluntary statutory or private?</h2>

<p> Anyone who has founded a company finds themselves in the comfortable situation of being able to choose at the beginning of their self-employment whether they want to take out voluntary statutory health insurance or prefer private health insurance. This decision is not trivial, as both have advantages and disadvantages - but once you have switched to the private system, it is not easy to return to the statutory health insurance scheme.
    In this guide, you will find an overview of what voluntary statutory health insurance means, how statutory health insurance differs from private health insurance and how the contributions are calculated in each case.
</p>    
    
<h2>What does it mean: Voluntarily insured - and yet compulsory?</h2>
    
<p>Why is it even called “voluntarily insured” if we have compulsory health insurance in Germany, i.e. every citizen has to take out health insurance? The reason for this is that above a certain income (“contribution assessment ceiling”), you can - but do not have to - opt out of statutory insurance. All self-employed people even have the choice between private and statutory health insurance. In all these cases, you become a voluntary member of statutory insurance if you choose this option.</p>    
    
    If you are self-employed, you can choose whether you want to be part of the statutory health insurance system voluntarily or take out private health insurance. No matter what you decide: As a self-employed person, you are responsible for the entire amount of the contributions, as no employer can cover half of them (one exception is the Künstlersozialkasse for artists and writers).
    
    What are the advantages of the Voluntary statutory health insurance?
    
    Voluntary statutory health insurance has advantages over private health insurance companies when it comes to the range of benefits: While private insurers are quite free to decide what they contractually guarantee their customers, the catalogue of benefits offered by health insurance companies is fixed by law and gives them little scope to differ from one another. Unlike private insurers, they cannot simply restrict or exclude economically sensitive service areas - e.g. mental illness. Statutory health insurance must cover everything that is considered medically necessary. In addition to this basic principle of a broad range of benefits, the most important arguments in favour of statutory cover are as follows: Only your income counts: In statutory health insurance, only the amount of your income is used to calculate your monthly contribution - other factors are not taken into account.
    
    The situation is different with private insurance companies: They enquire very carefully about your state of health and also take your age into account when calculating your premium. This means that your premium for private health insurance is low if you are young and healthy. However, it can quickly become quite high if you are older or if you have pre-existing conditions when you take out the policy. For example, if you have a chronic illness, this does not matter for statutory health insurance, but it does for private health insurance. This can result in benefit exclusions or premium surcharges.
    
    Family insurance: In statutory health insurance, you can also insure your children and (if they do not earn money themselves) your spouse. They are then part of the “family insurance” and do not pay their own contributions. Private insurers do not offer this - each person must be insured individually. As already mentioned, the decisive criterion for co-insuring your family is their unemployment: If your partner has no income at all or at most income from marginal employment, you can co-insure them. No advance payments: Have you ever seen a doctor’s bill?
    
    There’s a simple reason for this: the statutory health insurance fund automatically takes care of paying them. Sure - sometimes additional payments are due, for example when buying medication at the pharmacy. But at least you don’t have to make full advance payments. If you have private health insurance, the bills will first arrive in your letterbox - and you usually have to pay them before you can submit them to your health insurance company to get the money back. In view of standard medical fees and high medicine prices, this can temporarily have a drastic impact on your account balance. Here too, statutory health insurance companies definitely score points.
    
    So what are the arguments in favour of private health insurance?
    
    The often better benefits offered by private health insurers are particularly worth mentioning here. Although their scope varies greatly - and this is also a challenge when choosing a provider and tariff - it can certainly be greater than that offered by statutory health insurance companies. As a private patient, you can often expect preferential treatment, fast appointments and single rooms for inpatient treatment in hospital.
    
    The situation is different for statutory health insurance patients: Long waits for appointments at the specialist practice are possible in some regions; you can’t choose whether and with whom you share your room in hospital. Co-payments for medication and dental prostheses can also be expensive in the short term - although this is usually still no comparison to the monthly costs of private health insurance.
    
    Once you have decided in favour of private health insurance, please note that you can only switch back to statutory health insurance in exceptional cases - as a rule, this is not possible in order to prevent “cherry-picking” from the two systems as far as possible.In addition, the favourable rates and potential savings for young people compared to statutory health insurance are reversed if the rates increase with age or if additional contributions that are included in the statutory system suddenly become due due to children or partners who are not working. Health insurance card is on the keyboard How high is the contribution to voluntary statutory health insurance?
    Basically, the costs of voluntary health insurance under the statutory system are fairly straightforward.We show you what is taken into account when calculating the contribution: Basi
    Basic contribution: This is 14.6 per cent of your income (as of 2020). We’ll explain what all falls under the term “income” in a moment.
    Additional contribution: Depending on the health insurance company, an additional contribution may be due, which is also based on your income. It is not fixed by law, but is levied (or not) by each health insurance company at its own discretion. The average amount is currently around 1.1 per cent.</p>
